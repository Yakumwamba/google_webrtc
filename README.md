## About this project 

 I created this project to learn how to use the Svelte library and to learn how to use the Svelte CLI. 
 This acts as a guide to how to use the Svelte CLI and webrtc in Svelte. It includes all the examples from https://webrtc.github.io/samples/ that demonstrate how the WebRTC API functions work.
 
 ## Demo 
 https://webrtc-mauve.vercel.app/webrtc
 
Once you've cloned this repo and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Before creating a production version of your app, install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs#adapters) for your target environment. Then:



## Testing on a Chrome Mobile browser
If you want to test on your mobile browser make sure to start the development server with this command `npm run dev --host --https` this allows the application to run in a secureContext which is required for us to access the `navigator` object.

‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING‚ö†Ô∏è *It is highly recommended to use headphones when testing these samples, as it will otherwise risk loud audio feedback on your system.*

Todo List
=========

The first part of this todo list todo list is to implement the getUserMedia() inside a svelete app which allows us to access the media devices on the client side (browser)

1. Basic getUserMedia demo
